# October 10, 2024 Market Event

## Summary
- **$19B** liquidations in 24 hours (largest in history)
- **1.6M traders** affected
- **87%** long positions ($16.6B) vs 13% shorts ($2.4B)
- BTC: $122k → $102k (-16.4%)
- Volume ATH, Liquidity ATL
- Auto-deleveraging imposed

## What Happened
Macro trigger (tariffs) → BTC drop → cascading liquidations → liquidity crisis → ADL events

## Speculation
Unconfirmed reports of major market maker (Binance/Wintermute) issues. Would explain liquidity disappearance and ADL necessity.

## USD_FRY Context
Built decentralized liquidity rails to process wreckage. Launched Oct 9, event Oct 10.

**Validates thesis:**
- Centralized liquidity = single point of failure
- When it fails, cascades happen
- Need decentralized alternatives

## Approach
- Document facts, don't celebrate
- Empathize with affected traders
- Offer demo as tool, not solution
- Acknowledge timing without marketing

## Sources
- CoinGlass (liquidation data)
- CryptoBriefing article
- Market observations
