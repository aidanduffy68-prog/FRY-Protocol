## Option 1: The Confession Booth
I built a demo where you can confess your trading losses and watch them turn into FRY tokens.

"How much did you lose? (be honest)"

That's the first thing it asks. Because on testnet, you can finally be honest about it.

Try it: https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/interactive-demo.html

Pick your coin (BTC, SOL, XRP, or FARTCOIN üí®), enter the damage, and watch real Arbitrum contracts process your wreckage into 2.26 FRY per $1.

Features:
‚Ä¢ Snarky terminal output that roasts your choices
‚Ä¢ Amount-based reactions ("bro... are you okay?")
‚Ä¢ Random Jeff meme popups
‚Ä¢ Frutiger Aero dolphin background (obviously)

Built on Arbitrum Sepolia. No real money harmed. Just your ego.

## Option 2: The Therapy Session (Recommended)
"How much did you lose? (be honest)"

I built an interactive demo that's basically a therapy session for bad trades.

It asks which coin rekt you (BTC, SOL, XRP, FARTCOIN üí®), how much damage you took, then processes your wreckage through real Arbitrum smart contracts.

The best part? It roasts you the entire time:
‚Ä¢ "let me guess, longed at $69k?"
‚Ä¢ "bro the SEC case is TOTALLY gonna settle"
‚Ä¢ "lmao you actually picked FARTCOIN üíÄ"

Try it: https://aidanduffy68-prog.github.io/USD_FRY/interactive-demo.html

On testnet, you can finally be honest about your losses. The terminal won't judge (much). The dolphins will understand. Jeff might show up.

Built with real smart contracts on Arbitrum Sepolia. Turn your L's into W's (kinda).

## Option 3: Maximum Honesty (Shortened)
Look, we've all been there.

You longed BTC at 'open skies'. You thought Worldcoin was different. You longed PUMP after ICO.

I built a place where you can finally be honest about it:

"How much did you lose? (be honest)"

Pick your coin. Enter the damage. Watch real Arbitrum contracts turn your wreckage into FRY tokens while the terminal roasts your life choices.

It's testnet. No real money. Just real catharsis.

## Recommended: Option 1 or 3
Option 1 hits the sweet spot - professional enough but keeps the edge.
Option 3 is maximum engagement bait if you want comments/shares.
