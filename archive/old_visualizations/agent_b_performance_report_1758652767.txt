1. DEMONSTRATION LAYER
   - Makes FRY mechanics tangible and observable
   - Clear performance metrics vs traditional approaches
   - Real-time proof of concept for institutional audiences

2. SIMULATION TESTBED
   - A/B testing framework: Agent B vs Traditional MM
   - Multiple market scenario testing capability
   - Performance optimization and parameter tuning

3. NARRATIVE SHIFT
   - Agent B is the 'Phil Ivey' of FRY - sophisticated edge capture
   - Not the house, but the player who clips edges intelligently
   - Transforms market inefficiencies into systematic advantages

4. INSTITUTIONAL HOOK
   - Easier for exchanges and funds to understand an agent vs abstract mechanics
   - Scalable across different market conditions and asset classes
   - Clear ROI demonstration with measurable performance metrics

TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS
----------------------------------------
