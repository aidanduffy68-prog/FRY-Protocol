The next edge in trading isn't speed or fancy UX 🎯

It's what you do with the losses.

Every exchange generates billions in "wreckage" 💥
→ Liquidations
→ Bad trades
→ Funding rate mismatches

Traditional playbook: Liquidity providers eat the losses → they leave → protocol dies 📉

What if losses made your protocol stronger instead? 🤔

That's FRY 🍟

We turn trading losses into productive assets through smart routing:

✅ Match opposite positions across exchanges (no token transfers needed)
✅ Use math to find perfect trade sizes (our secret sauce)
✅ AI that gets smarter with every trade

**The results:**
→ 7.4x better capital efficiency
→ 61.5% less volatility
→ $2.3M already processed

Here's the insight 💡

Most protocols compete on execution speed.

The real moat? **Treasury management.**

When losses flow through the right paths, they don't just disappear — they turn into liquidity that strengthens your ecosystem.

That's the edge.
